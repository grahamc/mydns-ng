SHORT TERM:

*	Add full checks for SRV, PTR, RP, and NAPTR to 'mydnscheck'.

*  Reply cache should obey shortest TTL in the cached RRSET.



LONG TERM:

*	Move SRV/RP/NAPTR extra data OUT of the mydns_rr structure -- leave the
	data in the "data" column and let it be parsed as needed.  The parsed
	data really gobbles up space in the MYDNS_RR structure.

*	Full IPv6 support (added to server, need support in utils).

*	Update manual:
	- How delegation works.

*	LOC (RFC 1876?) support.

*	Make sure we're NEVER using inet_ntoa, inet_addr, etc.

*	Fix in_cidr to work with IPv6 addresses.

*	Test AXFR from an IPv6 master via `mydns-import'.

*	Investigate linker problem with `-ffast-math' on FreeBSD/alpha:

		/usr/lib/crtfastmath.o: In function `set_fast_math':
		/usr/lib/crtfastmath.o(.text+0x1c): undefined reference to
			`__ieee_set_fp_control'

*	No calls to gethostbyname() anywhere -- add `--enable-static-build'
	back to the `./configure' line in pkg/mydns-mysql.spec.in.
